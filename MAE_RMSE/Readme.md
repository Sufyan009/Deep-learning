## Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**

* Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
* It's a simple and interpretable metric.
* **Formula:**
  ```
  MAE = (1/n) * Σ|yi - ŷi|
  ```
  Where:
  - `n`: Number of data points
  - `yi`: Actual value
  - `ŷi`: Predicted value

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**

* Measures the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.
* It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors.
* **Formula:**
  ```
  RMSE = sqrt((1/n) * Σ(yi - ŷi)^2)
  ```

**Choosing Between MAE and RMSE:**

* **MAE:**
  - Easier to interpret.
  - Less sensitive to outliers.
  - Suitable when all errors are equally important.
* **RMSE:**
  - More sensitive to outliers.
  - Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
  - Suitable when large errors are more critical.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Assuming y_true and y_pred are your true and predicted values
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred, squared=False)

print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
print("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse)
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Scaling:** Scaling the data can significantly impact the performance of these metrics.
* **Contextual Interpretation:** The choice of metric depends on the specific problem and the desired interpretation of errors.
* **Combined Use:** In some cases, using both MAE and RMSE can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

By understanding the nuances of MAE and RMSE, you can effectively evaluate the performance of your regression models and make informed decisions.
